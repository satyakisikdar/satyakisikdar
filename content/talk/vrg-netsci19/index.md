abstract = "Arguably the most relevant task in the study of graphs is the identification, extraction, and representation of the small substructures that, in aggregate, describe the underlying phenomenon encoded by the graph. From an extracted model, containing the LEGO-like building blocks of real-world graphs, we are able to perform deep scientific analysis and make predictions about the data. With this goal in mind, the present work describes a vertex replacement grammar (VRG), which contains graphical rewriting rules that can match and replace graph fragments similar to how a context-free grammar (CFG) rewrites characters in a string. These graph fragments represent a concise description of the network building blocks, and the rewriting rules of the VRG encodes the instructions about how the graph is pieced together."
