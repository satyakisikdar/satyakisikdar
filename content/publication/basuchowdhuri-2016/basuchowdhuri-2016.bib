 abstract = {Community structures are inherent in social networks and finding them is an interesting and well-studied problem. Finding community structures in social networks is similar to locating densely connected clusters of nodes in a graph. One of the popular methods for finding communities is to first find the inter-community edges and then removing them to reveal the communities. It is well-known that a network centrality measure named edge betweenness can be used to detect the inter-community edges. The edges with high edge betweenness are those that fall in a large number of shortest paths out of all possible pairs of shortest paths. Finding all-pair shortest paths is a computationally expensive task, es-pecially for large-sized graphs. So we construct a t-spanner, a known graph sparsification technique, for finding edges with high betweenness and eventually find communities by removing such edges. Using the t-spanner, we then detect the inter-community edges within O(km) running time by building a distance oracle of size O(kn 1+ 1 k), where t = 2k-1. Compared to the traditional community detection methods dependent on calculation of betweenness values, our algo-rithm runs much faster. Experiments show that our algo-rithm finds communities of quality comparable to the other state-of-the-art community detection algorithms.},
