Hi all! Thanks for checking out my new blog.

I am intrigued by anything related to graphs/networks. I also like to play around with Python and $\LaTeX$. 
I think I'll talk about my research on graphs in the next blog, which should be a natural starting point. 

Also, I'm quite inept at managing websites, so apologies in advance if I do something stupid and this whole site disappears!
