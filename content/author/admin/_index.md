I'm a 2<sup>nd</sup> year Ph.D. student at the [Department of Computer Science & Engineering](https://cse.nd.edu) at the [University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu) advised by [Dr. Tim Weninger](https://www3.nd.edu/~tweninge). I am also a member of the Interdisciplinary Center for Network Science and Applications [(iCeNSA)](http://icensa.com).  

My research centers on the intersection of formal language theory and network science. More specifically, I study graph generation models using graph grammars.

Before this, I worked on community detection in complex networks at the Social Network Analysis Research Group at [Heritage Institute of Technology, Kolkata, India](http://heritageit.edu).

In my spare time, I like to fiddle around Python and $\LaTeX$.
